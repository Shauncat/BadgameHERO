### Offensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 30:
* the number of DCs in the character’s most powerful attack (or the Active Points in the attack divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible OCV with his most powerful attack (assuming he uses all Combat Skill Levels for OCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in primarily offensive powers like Aid

### Defensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 30:
* the total points in the character’s most powerful defense (or the Active Points in that defense, divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible DCV (assuming he uses all applicable Combat Skill Levels for DCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly-used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in primarily defensive powers like Invisibility or Desolidification

### Schitcks
A character is allowed to violate the 12DC and Rule of X limitations for one power, and one power only. This power is their Schtick. It can go up to 15DC (75AP), and for the purposes of Rule of X, counts as if it were 15 AP lower. For example, Princess Melody's Blazing Power Chord (Blast 15d6) is 75 AP, but her offensive ability is balanced as if it were 60AP (a Blast 12d6).
