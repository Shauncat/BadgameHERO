## Magical Girl Factions 
### The Court of Lemuria 
Before the dawn of modern civilization, two empires ruled mighty.

One, the Sorcerer-Kings of Mu, used dark thaumaturgy and the blood of their slave caste to amass power. It was through their alchemical experiments the *youma*, weaponized vampires of human spiritual energy, were first brought to life. Though tainted by hubris, all of their civic works were a marvel to behold. 

The other was they sky-cities of Lemuria, ruled by an beneficent, matriarchal theocracy. Young girls of proven virtue and strength were chosen to be ordained into the Lemurian Court, and receive soul-bound weapons of enchanted Lemurite, that, among other powers, allowed them to transform into an eidolon or "princess" form. These swords, rods, hammers, chains, bows,  and staves allowed the Court to retain accumulated power and wisdom across multiple lifetimes, as the weapon would always return to them after they reincarnated. 

In subsequent generations, this would result in fewer and fewer girls uplifting themselves through heart and skill, and more being chosen by heavenly birthright. However, before this had the chance to lead to crippling societal stagnation, the two empires came to a war that would consume them both. The Lemurian priestesses crusaded to cleanse their blighted laboratories and blood-soaked ziggurats from the land, while the sorcerers of Mu sought to steal the secrets of Lemurite artifice, and take the most magically gifted of them as brides. 

The war sunk most of both landmasses into what we know as the Pacific Ocean, leaving nothing but coral reefs behind. That is, except for the Lemurian High Temple. Falling from the sky, it burned bright, and sank deep into the ground in a land that would some day call itself Nippon. It, and the Court of Lemuria, slept dormant for thousands of years, the epoch of high magic brought to a bloody end. 

In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck, and the temple was no longer sealed by millions of tons of rock and dirt. Lemurite weapons once again manifested in the hands of their eternal owners, and creatures of darkness were once more smitten in the name of justice. Magical Girls once again roamed the Earth, though the Court would, in the years to come, not be the only ones to bear that moniker. 

> #### GAME MECHANICS
Reincarnates of the Court of Lemuria typically use some sort of transformation, either Shape Shift + powers with an an Only In Alternated Identity limitation, or Multiform. Lemurite weapons are built using the Obvious Inaccessible Focus limitation on powers, and are Unbreakable (they can only be made or unmade using the long-forgotten secrets of the Lemurian artificers). 

### The Arcannon Genius Girl Academy 
In the Astral plane, a nexus was formed where beings of great cosmic power could come and trade artifacts, talk shop, and conduct other business with the mutual assurance that no one would summon a vast army of demons, unleash a reality-warping bomb, or stab them in the back with a soul-sucking dagger. As often happens with bustling trade hubs, people found themselves wanting to settle there, and start a family, even the mighty wizards, whose vows of chastity were often enough a cover for social awkwardness. Thus, the city of Arcannon was founded. 

With urban families comes the desire for institutions of education. The Arcannon Genius Girl Academy was one such business to answer the call, grooming young ladies into witches, wizards,  demonologists, and mad scientists. 

Sadly, not every girl can have the biggest of brain, and not every family can shore up the Academy's considerable tuition. For them, "field work" exists, for those that need extra credit or financial assistance: travelling to a low-magic planet to live among their kind, study their culture, and locate rare magical macguffins that are hidden away there like pearls among swine. 

Earth is one such planet. Japan has proven especially popular for Academy field work, due to its high quality schools and fanciful architecture. 

> #### GAME MECHANICS
Academy students typically have the Power (Magic) and Invention (Magical Research) skills, as well as several Knowledge skills related to specific fields of magical study. Requires A Roll limitations are used strategically to save points, ideally leading to hilarious accidents that are ultimately not fatal. While they have more powers out of costume than a Lemurian reincarnate, many have elaborate transformation sequences, or claim their floppy hats as an Obvious Inaccessible Focus (durable). Gestures and Incantations feature heavily, and should be roleplayed when they do. 

### Galactic Rune Police Department 

Some of the most dangerous places in the universe can be low-magic planets where the populace is blissfully unaware of the true nature of reality. They make great dens for smuggling contraband weapons and conducting space piracy, hideouts for dangerous fugitives, and suitable locations for soul harvesting operations. With the irresponsible use of time travel magic that goes on on them, they're also prone to paradox storms. To combat this, the GRPD has sent undercover agents to these worlds to keep an eye on them. 

These agents are specially selected from a pool of species that resemble the teenage girls of that world. It's found that, in most cases, failures to understand the social customs of a planet are mostly forgiven when they have a pretty face attached to them. In Earth's case, they're also humans girls recruited from their more high-magic past and future epochs (though only one such agent per unit, to prevent conflicting timelines from converging). 

> ####GAME MECHANICS
Rune Police carry standard issue gadgets as Foci, such as Rune Pistols which consume charges to unleash blasts of energy, crystal communicators that allow them to Mind Link to HQ, and Entangling grenades of expanding adhesive foam for detaining criminals. Summonable armor can be built using OIF and Extra Time (only to activate) on defenses. 

### Dames of Twilight
Before the great yawning abyss of nothingness lies the last remaining vestige of reality, a galaxy known as the Twilight Void. Here, a race of demons, outcast by territorial feuds of the Great Demon Lords, and the crusades of the astral wizards, settled.  Through the vicious cunning and regal grace of their ruler, Queen Carob, their Imperium flourished and the habitable worlds of the Twilight Void were brought to heel. 

Though relatively weak compared to her cosmos-shaping Demon Lord contemporaries, Queen Carob has a gift that greatly aids her colonial efforts, the ability to "corrupt" (in the terms of other cultures) or "knighting" (in their own words) any sentient creature with some inborn talent for magic into a demon like themselves. Through this power, she created the various orders and mystery cults than enforce their will and expand the Imperium across the multiverse; such as the Portal Mages, the Quaestors, the Phantasmal Circus, and her personal court, the Dames of Twilight. 

Bound to their queen, these gorgons, succubae, vampires, and other feminine creatures of darkness are given training in sorcery and sent on quests for new realms to conquer and magical artifacts to recover. Those who do well are given entire planets as demesnes. 

While the Quaestors prever conquest, with orbital battle fleets, and marching  of large platoons through interdimensional Twilight Gates, the Dames prefer subversion. With diplomacy as sharp as any sword, they turn a world to their favor, so that when the Twilight Imperium finally does arrive in mass, they are celebrated, instead of met by guerillas. 

Dames on Earth may even find themselves in a circle of Magical Girls, fighting on what is nominally the side of good. After all, what good is a planet to the Imperium that has already been razed by some cosmic horror? What better way to win favor with the population of a world than to get rid of their monsters? As Queen Carob doesn't discourage infighting, they can even find themselves in a feud with another Twilight Demon working their own ends on Earth. 

> #### GAME MECHANICS
when a Dame uses a "transformation sequence", they're often simply shedding their human disguise. This can be achieved with Shape Shift in a multipower, for one possible way of doing it. The Queen can also Mind Link to any Dame, but it's not necessary for the power to "phone home" be purchased for themselves. 

## Magical Girl Circles 
In 21st century Earth, technology reigns supreme and magic is a myth. Well, we know it is real, but most of Earth's humans will laugh off or rationalize magic, even while observing it. This leaves Magical Girls with little organizational support or sympathy from their peers. Where they do find it, they get in their Circle. 

When a grouping of magical girls decides to cooperate for mutual protection, training, and emotional support, they form a Circle. If they don't already attend the same school, they transfer.  This allows them to meet up at least once a day, or more if they share a club. 

Sometimes Circles will come into conflict. Not everyone can agree on what "responsible use of magic" means. Sometimes there just aren't enough rare, potent crystals for everyone to share. Sometimes a gang of magical female banchos is just a bigger threat than the monster of the week. 
## The Eyes of Heaven 
### Genesis 
Earth is currently, as of this writing, wihin a low-magic epoch. Magic however, quantifiably exists, and so mortal society creates institutions to observe and control it. As far back as ancient Egypt, there have existed hierarchies to carefully reign in the study of magic, to share secrets across national boundaries, and brand those who threaten to topple the status quo with magic as dangerous heretics. 

As global communication became increasingly easier, and the currency of global trade became increasingly abstract, the libraries of data such groups accumulated increased quadratically, their ingratiation with state powers grew, and they began to consolidate more and more. Popular media served to discredit anyone who would reveal their existence  as conspiracy theorists, or having lifted the idea of Knights Templar-like groups running amok from a video game. 

Then Wikileaks happened. DARPANET, once their greatest asset, had bitten them in the ass. When Edward Snowden revealed the Five Eyes network, it nearly compromised the "Eyes of Heaven" wires as well. 

At the same time, more and more reports of "Magical Girls" were appearing on the Internet, and of the incidents they were causing. There was little choice left. The "Eyes of Heaven" name was formalized, while at the same time, a massive disinformation campaign was waged across anonymous message boards, so that anyone using the name in public appeared to be a crazed hikikomori NEET peddling alternative facts. 

### The Kuga Group 
After World War 2, Saikawa Tsune, heiress to the estate of a great crime family, decided to take things legit. With infusions of capital from General Douglas MacArthur, she built up her inherited properties, and acquired more. And so on, until her net worth was in the billions (of US$). 

Eccentric that she was, she married an archaeologist, Kuga Oroku, who was one of the last remaining formally educated onmyouji, and member of what would become known as the Eyes of Heaven. Together, they embarked on the Kuga Tower project, a Yokohama skyscraper to be built on the foundation of a building condemned by the Great Kanto Earthquake. In truth, the earthquake had opened up a passageway to a vast, ancient ruin believed to be older than Babylon. While Kuga Tower appeared as a place of business and residence to the streets, those with access were able to descend and study the ruins. 

Today, the Kuga family is well known for their philantrhopy, entrepreneurship, and efforts to make Japan great again. Since Kuga Tsune, the estate has been passed down matrilineally, as each heiress has born only a single daughter, who uses the Kuga name for business dealings. It is also rumored that each one has been a Magical Girl. 
### The Black Site 
A location rumored to be in the deserts of Texas, close to the US-Mexico border, where girls kidnapped from impoverished parts of the world are trafficked in and experimented on, in an attempt to create Magical Girls artificially, and indoctrinate them as agents of the global agenda. If the rumors are to be believed, they've even managed to synthesize lemurite alloys. 

All anyone has seen going out that direction is the Derringer Cattle Ranch, however. Further exploration is discouraged, due to the area's heavy use by killer drug cartels.
