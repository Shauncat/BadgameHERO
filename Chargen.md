Mental Combat Values are no longer used. ALl powers that use them should take the Alternate Combat Value (OCV vs DCV) advantage (since this usually doesn't change the AP or RC, you may not need to bother). The 3 free points of OMCV and DMCV can no longer be sold back.

Mental Defense is still in use, and a worthwhile investment.

### Offensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 30:
* the number of DCs in the character’s most powerful attack (or the Active Points in the attack divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible OCV with his most powerful attack (assuming he uses all Combat Skill Levels for OCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in powers that are not attacks, but have significant offensive utility, like Aid

### Defensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 35:
* the total points in the character’s most powerful defense (or the Active Points in that defense, divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible DCV (assuming he uses all applicable Combat Skill Levels for DCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly-used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in powers that are not defenses, but have significant defensive utility, like Invisibility or Desolidification

### Skill Rolls
15- is an *effective*, rather than *hard*, cap. This means that, at the table, you should generally not be rolling with target numbers greater than 15. However, skill levels can be bought to account for the penalties associated with mechanics such as Requires a Roll, Variable Pool Powers, Power SKills, and the EGO vs EGO roll for Summon.

PER, Detect, and Talent rolls should also have an effective limit of 15-. Complimentary Skill Rolls may raise a given roll to 15+bonus.
