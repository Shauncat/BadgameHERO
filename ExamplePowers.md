## Galactic Rune Police
### Standard Issue GRPD Rune Handcannon (AP: 60; Real Cost 30)
> Blast 12d6 (60 Active Points); OAF (-1), 4 clips of 8 Charges (-0)

The Handcannon is one of the first rune gadgets a GRPD agent learns to operate. It uses a crystal capacitor that ejects swiftly for active reloading. Effective, but lacks versatility; experienced agents are encouraged to diversify their loadout.
## Antagonist Powers
These are less useful for PCs, but can illustrate the GM's internal logic, and how it relates to the HERO rules.
### Create Tsukumogami Youma (AP: 60; Real Cost 60)
> Severe Transform 4d6 (sympathetic object into 400-point youma, healed back by exorcism-SFX Transform, or reducing the youma to 0 BODY)

This creates minions from an ordinary object, similar to the Akanbe from Smile PreCure. Unlike a Summon, they cannot be given orders, and thus, are worth little except a distraction. The standard effect on 4d6 is 12, so for a 15-20 body bruiser, it likely takes two Phases to create.
