### Offensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 30:
* the number of DCs in the character’s most powerful attack (or the Active Points in the attack divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible OCV with his most powerful attack (assuming he uses all Combat Skill Levels for OCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in powers that are not attacks, but have significant offensive utility, like Aid

### Defensive Rule of X
The following should total no more than 35:
* the total points in the character’s most powerful defense (or the Active Points in that defense, divided by 5)
* the character’s highest possible DCV (assuming he uses all applicable Combat Skill Levels for DCV; the GM may or may not also want to include bonuses from commonly-used Combat or Martial Maneuvers)
* the character’s SPD
* the Active Points divided by 5 in powers that are not defenses, but have significant defensive utility, like Invisibility or Desolidification
